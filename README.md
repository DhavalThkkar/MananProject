# Install the necessary libraries
I would suggest you to install the anaconda3 distribution from Continuum Analytics
Based on the operating system download the distribution<br/>
For Windows : https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-4.4.0-Windows-x86_64.exe<br/>
For Linux : https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-4.4.0-Linux-x86_64.sh<br/>

RNN requires Keras library and TensorFlow
Keras : "sudo pip install keras"<br/>
TensorFlow: "sudo pip install tensorflow"<br/>

If there are any issues, post it in the Issues.
